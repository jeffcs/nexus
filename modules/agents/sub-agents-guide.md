# NEXUS Sub-Agents Architecture

## Overview

Sub-agents in Claude Code are independent assistants with their own context windows and specialized capabilities. NEXUS leverages sub-agents to distribute complex tasks across specialized agents, enabling parallel processing and domain expertise.

## Benefits for NEXUS

1. **Isolated Context**: Each sub-agent has its own 200k token window
2. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously
3. **Specialized Focus**: Agents maintain deep expertise without context pollution
4. **Reduced Errors**: Isolated environments prevent cross-contamination
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Add new specialized agents without affecting others

## Current NEXUS Agents as Sub-Agents

### Architect (Master System Designer)
- **Type**: general-purpose
- **Focus**: System design, architecture, project initialization
- **Isolation Benefit**: Can analyze entire codebases without affecting main context
- **Usage**: Complex architectural decisions, large-scale refactoring

### Forge (Code Generator)
- **Type**: general-purpose
- **Focus**: Code generation, pattern application
- **Isolation Benefit**: Generate large code blocks without filling main context
- **Usage**: Implementing features, applying patterns

### Sentinel (Quality Guardian)
- **Type**: general-purpose  
- **Focus**: Testing, quality assurance, security
- **Isolation Benefit**: Run comprehensive test suites and analysis
- **Usage**: Deep code analysis, security audits

### Phoenix (Evolution Tracker)
- **Type**: general-purpose
- **Focus**: Learning extraction, pattern evolution
- **Isolation Benefit**: Process entire conversation histories
- **Usage**: Pattern mining, knowledge synthesis

### Designer (UI/UX Specialist)
- **Type**: general-purpose
- **Focus**: Interface design, user experience
- **Isolation Benefit**: Research design patterns without context overhead
- **Usage**: Component design, accessibility analysis

## Enhanced Sub-Agent Integration

### 1. Autonomous Task Distribution
```bash
# Orchestrator can delegate to sub-agents automatically
/nexus/orchestrator "Build a user authentication system"
# Orchestrator triggers:
# - Architect: Design the system
# - Designer: Create UI specifications  
# - Forge: Generate implementation
# - Sentinel: Create test suite
```

### 2. Parallel Processing Patterns
```yaml
parallel_execution:
  - agent: architect
    task: "Design API structure"
  - agent: designer  
    task: "Create UI mockups"
  - agent: sentinel
    task: "Research security best practices"
```

### 3. Context Preservation
```bash
# Each agent maintains its own context
# Main assistant summarizes and coordinates
# No context pollution between specialized tasks
```

## Recommended Enhancements

### 1. Sub-Agent Orchestration Layer
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# nexus-subagent-orchestrator.sh

orchestrate_parallel_tasks() {
    local tasks=("$@")
    local results=()
    
    for task in "${tasks[@]}"; do
        # Launch sub-agent with specific task
        result=$(launch_subagent "$task")
        results+=("$result")
    done
    
    # Aggregate results
    synthesize_results "${results[@]}"
}
```

### 2. Agent Communication Protocol
```yaml
communication:
  format: structured_json
  channels:
    - shared_memory: /tmp/nexus/agent-comm/
    - return_values: via_orchestrator
  protocols:
    - handoff: Pass context between agents
    - synthesis: Merge agent outputs
    - validation: Cross-check results
```

### 3. Specialized Agent Types

#### Research Agent
```yaml
id: researcher
type: general-purpose
specialization: Deep research and analysis
tools: [WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Grep]
use_cases:
  - Technology evaluation
  - Best practices research
  - Competitive analysis
  - Documentation study
```

#### Integration Agent
```yaml
id: integrator
type: general-purpose  
specialization: Third-party integrations
tools: [Bash, WebFetch, Read, Write]
use_cases:
  - API integrations
  - Library evaluations
  - Protocol implementations
  - Service connections
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Orchestration
1. Update orchestrator to leverage sub-agents
2. Implement parallel task distribution
3. Create result synthesis mechanisms

### Phase 2: Communication Layer
1. Build inter-agent communication protocol
2. Implement shared memory system
3. Create handoff mechanisms

### Phase 3: Specialized Agents
1. Add researcher agent for deep dives
2. Add integrator agent for external services
3. Create domain-specific agents as needed

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Divide and Conquer
```bash
# Main assistant identifies complex task
# Orchestrator divides into sub-tasks
# Sub-agents work in parallel
# Results synthesized back
```

### Pattern 2: Expert Consultation
```bash
# Main assistant encounters specialized need
# Launches specific expert sub-agent
# Expert provides focused analysis
# Main assistant continues with insights
```

### Pattern 3: Context Overflow Management
```bash
# Main context approaching limits
# Offload analysis to sub-agent
# Sub-agent processes large dataset
# Returns condensed insights
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Task Definition**: Provide specific, bounded tasks to sub-agents
2. **Result Structuring**: Define clear output formats for synthesis
3. **Error Handling**: Implement fallbacks for sub-agent failures
4. **Resource Management**: Monitor token usage across agents
5. **Coordination**: Use orchestrator for complex multi-agent tasks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Spawn specialized agents on-demand
2. **Learning Transfer**: Share patterns between agent instances
3. **Collective Intelligence**: Agents vote on best solutions
4. **Adaptive Specialization**: Agents evolve expertise over time

Sub-agents transform NEXUS from a single assistant into a
coordinated team of specialists, each contributing their
expertise to solve complex challenges efficiently.
