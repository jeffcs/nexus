# Product Patterns

**Context**: Need to understand user journey and prioritize features

**Structure**:
```
User Goal: [What user wants to achieve]
|
Steps: [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3]
       ↓          ↓          ↓
MVP:   [Feature]  [Feature]  [Feature]
Later: [Feature]  [Feature]  [Feature]
```

**Example**:
```
