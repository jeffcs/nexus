# Architectural & Design Decisions

> Version: 1.0.0
> Purpose: Document key decisions and their rationale

## Decision Log Format

Each decision follows this structure:
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: What prompted the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this choice was made
- **Consequences**: Expected impact
- **Alternatives**: What else was considered

## Decisions

### 2025-01-31: Agent-Based Architecture

**Context**: Need for specialized AI assistance in development workflow

**Decision**: Implement five specialized agents (Designer, Architect, Developer, Technician, Discovery) rather than a monolithic assistant

**Rationale**:
- Separation of concerns allows deeper specialization
- Natural collaboration mirrors human teams
- Easier to maintain and evolve individual agents
- Clear activation triggers reduce confusion

**Consequences**:
- More focused and expert responses
- Better quality in each domain
- Need for coordination mechanisms
- Potential for agent collaboration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single omniscient agent (too complex)
- Rule-based system (too rigid)
- Plugin architecture (less natural)

### 2025-01-31: Pattern-Based Learning System

**Context**: Agents need to learn and adapt from usage

**Decision**: Implement pattern recognition and storage in domain-specific directories

**Rationale**:
- Patterns emerge naturally from usage
- Domain separation keeps patterns focused
- Easy to version and share patterns
- Human-readable and editable

**Consequences**:
- Continuous improvement over time
- Shareable knowledge base
- Need for pattern management
- Storage requirements grow

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database storage (less portable)
- Cloud-based learning (privacy concerns)
- No learning system (missed opportunity)

### 2025-01-31: Natural Language Activation

**Context**: How users invoke specific agents

**Decision**: Use natural language triggers rather than commands

**Rationale**:
- More intuitive for users
- Flexible activation patterns
- No command memorization needed
- Graceful fallbacks possible

**Consequences**:
- Natural conversation flow
- Some ambiguity possible
- Need for clear examples
- Pattern matching required

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Slash commands (less natural)
- Menu selection (breaks flow)
- Explicit agent naming (verbose)

## Future Decisions

Space for upcoming architectural and design decisions as the system evolves.
