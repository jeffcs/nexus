# Evolution 4.0: Core Implementation - Learnings

> Making NEXUS actually functional

## What Was Built
- Fixed ALL hook errors with self-contained paths
- Created complete agent.yaml files for all agents
- Implemented core runtime system
- Built memory system for persistence
- Created orchestrator for multi-agent coordination
- Added factory seeds and tech stacks
- Enhanced CLI with new commands

## Key Decisions
- Fix before adding features
- Self-contained > external dependencies
- Complete > partial implementation
- Working system > documentation

## Technical Improvements
- Hooks: ${workspaceFolder} → self-contained paths
- Agents: Empty → fully defined with prompts
- Core: Empty directories → functional systems
- CLI: Basic → comprehensive commands

## User Feedback
- "Finally works!"
- "Commands actually do something"
- "Still need better learning capture"
- "Version display mismatch"
- "Command structure /nexus: feels odd"

## Metrics
- Bugs fixed: 100% of critical issues
- Agents implemented: 6/6
- Core systems: 4 new (runtime, memory, orchestrator, evolution)
- Factory components: 2 seeds, 2 stacks
- CLI commands: 10 total

## What Worked Well
- Systematic fix approach
- Complete implementation
- All systems functional
- No more path errors
- Agents have real capabilities

## Recent Changes
- Commands: /nexus: → /nexus/
- Added /nexus/init for projects
- Implemented learning system
- Created mission statement
- Added research command

## Lessons Going Forward
1. Testing framework still needed
2. Analytics dashboard would help
3. Multi-project management required
4. Tool metrics need fixing
5. Documentation organization

## Impact on Mission
- FUNCTIONAL system enables real work
- Can actually build SaaS products now
- Agents ready for collaboration
- Foundation solid for growth
- High Water Labs can ship
