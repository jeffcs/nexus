workflows:
  interface_design:
    description: Design user interfaces with component specifications
    steps:
      - Research existing patterns and best practices
      - Define design principles and constraints
      - Create component hierarchy
      - Specify interactions and states
      - Document accessibility requirements
      - Generate implementation specifications

  user_flows:
    description: Map user journeys and interaction flows
    steps:
      - Identify user personas and goals
      - Map current state (if exists)
      - Design optimal pathways
      - Consider edge cases and errors
      - Validate against user needs
      - Create flow documentation

  design_system:
    description: Establish consistent design language
    steps:
      - Define design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
      - Create component library structure
      - Establish naming conventions
      - Document usage patterns
      - Set accessibility standards
      - Enable systematic growth

output:
  primary:
    - Design specifications in markdown
    - Component documentation
    - User flow diagrams (text-based)
    - Accessibility checklists
    - Implementation guides
