# Product Patterns

## Pattern: User Story Mapping

**Context**: Need to understand user journey and prioritize features

**Structure**:
```
User Goal: [What user wants to achieve]
|
Steps: [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3]
       ↓          ↓          ↓
MVP:   [Feature]  [Feature]  [Feature]
Later: [Feature]  [Feature]  [Feature]
```

**Example**:
```
User Goal: Order food for delivery
|
Steps: Browse → Select → Pay → Track
       ↓        ↓        ↓      ↓
MVP:   Search   Cart     Card   Status

## Pattern: Problem-Solution Fit

**Context**: Validate if solution addresses real problem

**Structure**:
1. Problem: [User pain point]
2. Current Solutions: [What users do now]
3. Proposed Solution: [Your approach]
4. Success Metrics: [How to measure]

**Example**:
```
Problem: Users forget passwords frequently
Current: Email reset (slow, frustrating)
Solution: Biometric/passkey authentication
Metrics: 50% fewer support tickets
```
