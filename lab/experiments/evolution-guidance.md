# Evolution Guidance

User Request: Add a /nexus:help command to show comprehensive documentation for the nexus system. Also, let's enhance our agents with more specific guidance and improve our blueprints and templates by deeply anaylyzing Agent OS and incorporating the best features of that system. Our aim is not to reproduce Agent OS here, just to take the best parts for structured, spec driven development and integrate them into the nexus system most efficiently and making use of the latest claude code features like sub agents

Please analyze this request and create an evolution script that:
1. Implements the requested changes
2. Updates any affected commands or configurations
3. Maintains system consistency
4. Documents the changes

Current NEXUS version: 2.0
