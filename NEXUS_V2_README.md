# Nexus V2: Agent-First Development

> Transform your development workflow with specialized AI agents that collaborate naturally

## What is Nexus V2?

Nexus V2 is an intelligent agent system for Claude Code that provides five specialized agents, each excelling in their domain:

- **👨‍🎨 Designer Agent** - Product management and UI/UX design
- **🏗️ Architect Agent** - System design and technical architecture
- **💻 Developer Agent** - Implementation and coding excellence
- **🔧 Technician Agent** - Debugging, DevOps, and production operations
- **🔍 Discovery Agent** - Research and technology exploration

## Why Nexus V2?

Traditional AI assistants try to do everything, resulting in shallow knowledge across domains. Nexus V2 takes a different approach:

- **Deep Specialization**: Each agent is an expert in their field
- **Natural Collaboration**: Agents work together like a real team
- **Continuous Learning**: The system learns from your project and improves over time
- **Zero Configuration**: Works immediately with natural language
- **Pattern Recognition**: Captures and reuses successful patterns

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run the installation script:

```bash
/path/to/nexus/install-nexus.sh
```

The installer will:
- Create the `.nexus` directory structure
- Install all five agents
- Configure Claude Code integration
- Set up the learning system
- Add usage documentation

### Basic Usage

Simply describe what you need in natural language:

```
"Design a user authentication flow"
"How should we architect a real-time chat?"
"Implement the payment processing feature"
"Debug why the API is returning 500 errors"
"Research best practices for caching"
```

The appropriate agent will automatically activate and help you.

## Advanced Features

### Agent Collaboration

Request multiple agents to work together:
```
"Designer and Architect: collaborate on a file upload feature"
```

### Pattern Learning

The system automatically learns from your usage:
- Recognizes successful patterns
- Adapts to your coding style
- Improves recommendations over time
- Stores patterns for reuse

### Context Awareness

Agents understand:
- Your project structure
- Technology stack
- Team preferences
- Previous decisions

## Directory Structure

After installation, your project will have:

```
.nexus/
├── agents/
│   ├── designer.md      # Designer agent definition
│   ├── architect.md     # Architect agent definition
│   ├── developer.md     # Developer agent definition
│   ├── technician.md    # Technician agent definition
│   └── discovery.md     # Discovery agent definition
├── patterns/
│   ├── design/         # UI/UX patterns
│   ├── architecture/   # System patterns
│   ├── code/          # Code patterns
│   └── operations/    # DevOps patterns
├── context/

│   └── ideals.md      # Project principles
├── learning/          # Learning system
└── nexus.md          # Usage guide
```

## Customization

### Project Ideals
Edit `.nexus/context/ideals.md` to define your project's:
- Core values
- Development principles
- Quality standards
- Team philosophy

### Decision Log
Document important decisions in `.nexus/context/decisions.md`:
- Architectural choices
- Technology selections
- Design decisions
- Process changes

## Integration

### With Claude Code
Nexus V2 integrates seamlessly with Claude Code. The agents are automatically available in your Claude Code sessions.

### With Your Workflow
- Use during planning sessions
- Integrate with code reviews
- Support debugging sessions
- Enhance documentation

## Examples

### New Feature Development
```
You: "I need to add user notifications"

Discovery: [researches notification patterns]
Designer: [creates UX flow]
Architect: [designs system architecture]
Developer: [implements the feature]
Technician: [ensures production readiness]
```

### Debugging Session
```
You: "The app is crashing on mobile devices"

Technician: [analyzes the issue]
Developer: [implements fix]
Designer: [verifies UX isn't affected]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide context and details
2. **Iterate Naturally**: Build on agent responses
3. **Trust Expertise**: Let agents guide in their domains
4. **Capture Patterns**: Save successful solutions
5. **Collaborate**: Use multiple agents for complex tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
- Use more specific triggers
- Explicitly name the agent: "Designer agent: ..."
- Check `.nexus/nexus.md` for examples

### Wrong Agent Activating
- Clarify your intent
- Use agent-specific keywords
- Name the desired agent explicitly
