# NEXUS
## Neural Execution & eXperimentation Unified System

> "The connection hub where human creativity meets AI capability"

NEXUS is a rapidly-evolving AI building operating system - a living framework for developing, orchestrating, and evolving AI-powered development workflows.

## Core Philosophy
- **Self-Modifying**: The system can rewrite and improve itself
- **Knowledge-Accumulating**: Every interaction teaches the system
- **Modular**: Hot-swappable components for maximum flexibility
- **AI-First**: Built to be understood and modified by AI agents

## Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize a new project with NEXUS
./self/evolve/bootstrap.sh my-new-project

# Run the genesis agent to design your system
nexus agent genesis --task "Design a real-time collaborative editor"

# Execute a complete workflow
nexus workflow full-stack-feature --spec requirements.md
```

## Structure
- `core/` - The kernel of your AI OS
- `modules/` - Pluggable capabilities and agents
- `lab/` - Experimentation space
- `vault/` - Knowledge repository
- `factory/` - Production templates
- `self/` - Self-modification hub

## Evolution
Track system growth: `git log --oneline --graph`
Current version: See `self/dna/version.json`
