# Nexus V2: Agent-First Development

> Transform your development workflow with specialized AI agents that collaborate naturally

## What is Nexus V2?

Nexus V2 is a streamlined development framework built around specialized AI agents that collaborate to deliver exceptional software. Rather than rigid workflows or complex abstractions, Nexus provides clear agent roles that work together naturally.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run the installation script:

```bash
/path/to/nexus/install-nexus.sh
```

The installer will:
- Create the `.nexus` directory structure
- Install all five agents
- Configure Claude Code integration
- Set up the learning system
- Add usage documentation

### Basic Usage

Simply describe what you need in natural language:

```
"Design a user authentication flow"
"How should we architect a real-time chat?"
"Implement the payment processing feature"
"Debug why the API is returning 500 errors"
"Research best practices for caching"
```

The appropriate agent will automatically activate and help you.

## Collaboration Patterns

### Design ‚Üí Architecture Dialog
When designing new features:
1. Designer proposes user experience
2. Architect evaluates technical feasibility
3. Both iterate until optimal solution emerges
4. Decisions documented automatically

### Architecture ‚Üí Development Flow
When implementing:
1. Architect provides technical design
2. Developer implements following patterns
3. Continuous feedback on implementation challenges
4. Patterns extracted for future use

### Production ‚Üí Technical Analysis
When issues arise:
1. Technician diagnoses the problem
2. Collaborates with Developer for fixes
3. Architect consulted for systemic issues
4. Learnings incorporated into patterns

## Directory Structure

After installation, your project will have:

```
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/          # Nexus agent definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.json    # Claude Code configuration

.nexus/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/         # Your project context (customizable)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project.md   # Project understanding
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions.md # Decision log
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ideals.md    # Project principles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/        # Agent-specific patterns
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product.md   # Product patterns
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ designer.md  # Design patterns
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architect.md # Architecture patterns
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ developer.md # Code patterns
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ technician.md # Operations patterns

nexus-guide.md       # Usage documentation
CLAUDE.md           # Project instructions
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Natural Collaboration
Agents work together through natural dialog, not rigid workflows. The Designer and Architect collaborate on feasibility. The Developer works from their combined output.

### 2. Context Awareness
Each agent deeply understands:
- Project mission and goals
- User needs and priorities
- Technical constraints
- Established patterns

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with simple agent interactions
- Add sophistication as needed
- Capture patterns through use
- Evolve based on results

### 4. Minimal Overhead
- No heavy documentation requirements
- Patterns captured automatically
- Decisions recorded through dialog
- Focus on delivering value

### 5. Quality Through Specialization
Each agent excels at their domain:
- Product ensures market fit
- Designer ensures delightful UX
- Architect ensures solid foundation
- Developer ensures quality implementation
- Technician ensures reliability

## Usage Examples

### New Feature Development
```
You: "I need to add user notifications"

Product: [researches user needs and solutions]
Designer: [creates UX flow]
Architect: [designs system architecture]
Developer: [implements the feature]
Technician: [ensures production readiness]
```

### Debugging Session
```
You: "The app is crashing on mobile devices"

Technician: [analyzes the issue]
Developer: [implements fix]
Designer: [verifies UX isn't affected]
```

### Performance Optimization
```
You: "The dashboard is loading slowly"

Technician: [profiles and identifies bottlenecks]
Architect: [designs optimization strategy]
Developer: [implements improvements]
Designer: [ensures UX isn't degraded]
```

## Customization

### Project Ideals
Edit `.nexus/context/ideals.md` to define your project's:
- Core values
- Development principles
- Quality standards
- Team philosophy

### Decision Log
Document important decisions in `.nexus/context/decisions.md`:
- Architectural choices
- Technology selections
- Design decisions
- Process changes

### Pattern Library
Patterns are stored in `.nexus/patterns/[agent].md` and can be extended by:
- Using the teacher agent: "teach architect to use Python for backends"
- Manually editing pattern files
- Building a knowledge base over time

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide context and details
2. **Start with Why**: Let Product understand the problem first
3. **Iterate Naturally**: Build on agent responses
4. **Trust Expertise**: Let agents guide in their domains
5. **Capture Patterns**: Save successful solutions
6. **Collaborate**: Use multiple agents for complex tasks

## Integration with Claude Code

Nexus V2 uses Claude Code's official subagent system:
- Agents are defined in `.claude/agents/`
- Automatically loaded when Claude Code starts
- Natural language activation based on context
- Full access to Claude Code tools

The system uses Claude Code's `settings.json`:
- Project settings: `.claude/settings.json`
- Local settings: `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored)
- See [Claude Code settings documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings)

## Success Metrics
