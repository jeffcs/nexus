## Project-Specific Instructions

This is the Nexus V2 framework repository itself. When working on this codebase:

1. Maintain the high quality of agent definitions
2. Ensure patterns are well-documented and reusable
3. Keep the installation process simple and reliable
4. Test all changes thoroughly
5. Document any new features or patterns

The agents should exemplify best practices in their respective domains.
